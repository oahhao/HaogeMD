# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Brand customization**: Renamed from ErgeMD to HaogeMD, author info replaced with 豪哥
- **App icon**: Brand-new HaogeMD icon (H+MD design), embedded as SVG component
- **Icon size**: Welcome page icon increased from 160px to 240px, About page icon from 104px to 120px

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **Double-clicking .md file only shows previous file**: Race condition between tab restoration effect and file association effect in `App.tsx`, where tab restoration's `setState()` overwrites file association's `currentFilePath`. Fixed by merging cold-start file association logic into the tab restoration effect
- **ConfigLevelSelector layer overlap and text ghosting**: Preview panel and dropdown content both in `createPortal` caused duplicate text rendering. Extracted preview panel from portal (always visible below button), simplified button text display when expanded, adjusted dropdown positioning calculation
- **ConfigLevelSelector production build missing styles**: Component inline `<style>` tag not rendering in Tauri v2 production webview, causing dropdown/icon/animation all to fail. Migrated all styles to `globals.css` with CSS variable fallback values
- **Markdown link click fails to open file**: `ContextMenuLink` `<a>` tag had no click interception, causing Tauri webview to navigate to `tauri://localhost/docs/...` (blank page). Added `onClick` handler that opens relative paths via `invoke("read_file")` + `openFile()`, external links keep browser behavior

### Improved

- **Performance mode dropdown positioning**: The dropdown now avoids clipping when overflowing the right panel; detects viewport boundaries and opens upward when space is insufficient
- **Scroll jump fix**: RightPanel/LeftPanel focus trap effect's `onToggle` dependency caused re-focusing to panel top on every `configLevel` change. Switched to `onToggleRef` to prevent unnecessary re-execution
- **ConfigLevelSelector cleanup**: Removed scroll save/restore, `tabIndex=-1` defensive code; reverted portal to conditional rendering

### Performance

- **White flash elimination**: Added `backgroundColor: #0A0A0F` to `tauri.conf.json` so the native window is dark from creation
- **Startup speed optimization**: Deferred workspace scanning to sidebar open, no longer blocking startup (saves 200-1000ms)
- **Loading indicator improvement**: Dark background + gradient logo + spinner + pulse animation
- **Tab restoration degradation**: Only loads first 5 tabs at startup; remaining tabs marked as unloaded and read on demand

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **QuickEdit save failure "No matching text found"**: When double-clicking to edit and save block-level elements (ZenUML / Mermaid / PlantUML / Callout), the string-based `replace` failed to find the original text due to CRLF/LF line ending inconsistencies or whitespace normalization. Added `quickEditLines.ts` utility with line-number-based precise replacement; `LazyMermaidBlock`, `LazyPlantUMLBlock`, and `ObsidianCallout` are now integrated; `useQuickEdit` uses line-number positioning when available, falling back to string replacement otherwise
- **Update check fails in network-restricted environments**: When both GitHub + Gitee APIs are unreachable, instead of throwing, the app now silently returns "no update available" (instead of the "check failed" toast); added `release_url` so the version badge opens the release page instead of downloading installer
- **Lint errors**: invalid regex escape in `generateExportHtml.ts`; empty catch block in `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **macOS support**: ErgeMD now runs on macOS 11+, with a universal `.dmg` installer covering both Apple Silicon and Intel
- **Linux support**: ErgeMD now runs on Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+, with `.AppImage` and `.deb` packages
- **Platform detection utility**: `src/utils/platform.ts` provides a unified `detectPlatform()` and `getPlatformLabel()` helper
- **Cross-platform update check**: `update.rs` matches assets by `target_os` keyword (Windows NSIS, macOS DMG, Linux AppImage)
- **Cross-platform reveal_in_explorer**: macOS uses `open -R`, Linux uses `xdg-open`, Windows keeps `explorer /select,`
- **Unit test infrastructure**: Vitest (frontend) + cargo test (Rust) two-layer test suite, enforced in CI

### Changed

- **PDF export**: macOS / Linux now use the system print dialog (users manually choose "Save as PDF"); Windows still uses WebView2 PrintToPdf
- **TitleBar**: hides the custom minimize / maximize / close buttons on macOS to avoid conflict with the system traffic lights
- **tauri.conf.json**: `bundle.targets` extended to `["nsis", "app", "dmg", "appimage", "deb"]` to enable all three platform bundles
- **release.yml**: expanded from single-platform Windows to a 4-platform matrix (Windows x64 / macOS arm64 / macOS x64 / Linux x64)
- **rename-bundle.js**: branches by `process.platform` / `BUILD_PLATFORM` env to handle `.app` / `.dmg` / `.AppImage` / `.deb`

### Notes

- The first cross-platform release **does not enable** macOS code signing (free-software strategy); users need to right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper

### Fixed

- Floating TOC misaligned on the ZenUML section: the `@mermaid-js/mermaid-zenuml` plugin injects @zenuml/core's bundled CSS via `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js`, which contains an unlayered universal selector `*, ::before, ::after { --tw-translate-y: 0; }` that outranks the host's Tailwind v4 `@layer utilities` rule and resets `--tw-translate-y` to 0, breaking the `.-translate-y-1/2` utility. The nav then starts at the 50% top anchor and extends straight down to the bottom-right corner. FloatingTOC's `-translate-y-1/2` is replaced with an inline `transform: translateY(-50%)`; the same latent risk in `SearchBar` / `UpdateChecker` (`-translate-x-1/2`) is replaced with inline `transform: translateX(-50%)` as well
- "Update check failed, please check your network" misreported in the About page: traced to three layered bugs — (1) Gitee Open API has no `/releases/latest` subpath (only GitHub does), the endpoint returned 404; (2) the repo has tags but no releases, the empty `/releases` list was parsed as an object and yielded empty fields; (3) GitHub's anonymous API limit (60/h) was exhausted by repeated dev-mode checks, all returning 403. All three fixed: Gitee switched to the list endpoint `/releases?per_page=1&page=1&direction=desc` taking the first item, with an empty array treated as "no release" and returning `Err` so `pick_latest` falls back gracefully; GitHub 403 now parses the `x-ratelimit-remaining` / `x-ratelimit-reset` headers, returning a clear "resets in ~X minutes" message on rate-limit hits (remaining=0), distinct from generic 403s; the `pick_latest` `(Ok, Ok)` arm's semantic misuse of `is_newer_version(gh, gi)` (which selected the smaller version, since `is_newer_version(a, b)` means `b > a`) is fixed by swapping to `is_newer_version(gi, gh)` to select the larger version

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Removed MSI artifact from Windows installer builds: `tauri.conf.json` `bundle.targets` changed from `["nsis", "msi"]` to `["nsis"]`; CI now produces only the NSIS installer and portable zip. Reduces build time and release size (MSI has minimal end-user adoption; enterprise deployment is not enabled)
- Default update-check download URL switched to the NSIS installer: renamed Rust `pick_msi_download_url` to `pick_nsis_download_url`; it now prefers `*setup.exe` assets (NSIS installer), then falls back to `*-portable.zip` (portable build), then to the release html_url; `.msi` assets are no longer parsed

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Mermaid ZenUML external plugin integration: added `@mermaid-js/mermaid-zenuml@0.2.3` dependency, enabling native rendering of the ZenUML sequence diagram (section 6.15). `MermaidDiagram` uses `ensureZenumlRegistered()` to idempotently register the plugin before `mermaid.initialize()`, with on-demand lazy loading of `@zenuml/core` triggered only when the `zenuml` keyword is detected
- Mermaid upgraded to 11.15.0: built-in Event Modeling support, the `eventmodeling` keyword (section 6.23) renders directly without external plugins
- MermaidDiagram theme type extensions: completed `ChartColors.zenuml` (text / border / bg) and the corresponding CSS variable passthrough in `getMermaidColors()`; also passes through base `fontColor` / `fontFamily` to keep ZenUML consistent with the global theme
- MermaidDiagram theme adaptation: added ZenUML and Event Modeling theme variable mappings (`mermaid-zenuml.css` / `mermaid-eventmodeling.css`); SVG post-processing injects `!important` rules to override the ZenUML plugin's hardcoded inline colors
- Theme CSS variable additions: `--mermaid-zenuml-lifeline` / `--mermaid-zenuml-message` for ZenUML; 15 `em*` series variables (5 box types: ui / processor / readmodel / command / event, plus relation / swimlane / arrowhead) for Event Modeling

### Changed

- `vite.config.ts` `chunkSizeWarningLimit` raised from 600 to 6500: the ZenUML plugin's `@zenuml/core@^3.47.0` dependency is large, expanding the mermaid chunk from ~1MB to ~6MB; this only silences the build warning — the actual artifact size is unchanged
- `UNSUPPORTED_DIAGRAM_TYPES` cleared: removed `zenuml` and `eventmodeling` entries; both diagram types are now supported
- `MarkdownSyntaxExample.md`: sections 6.15 (ZenUML) and 6.23 (Event Modeling) notes updated from "not supported" to "supported"

### Fixed

- ZenUML message lines invisible after theme adaptation: the original `.fragment-border` CSS is `fill: none` (transparent), but the theme adaptation erroneously changed it to an opaque background color, which occluded the message lines. Restored `fill: none` while keeping the `stroke` theme adaptation

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Latest version badge next to the version number in the About page: AboutPage now automatically invokes `forceCheckUpdate` on mount. When a new version is detected, a green `↑ v{latestVersion}` badge appears to the right of the `↻` button; clicking it opens the MSI installer download URL for the latest release
- Added `action` field to `ToastMessage`: Toasts can now carry a clickable button (e.g., "Download") that calls `openUrl` to open an external link
- Update check result now includes `download_url`: Rust `fetch_github_latest` / `fetch_gitee_latest` prefer the `.msi` asset's `browser_download_url` from the release's `assets` array, falling back to the release page's `html_url` if not found

### Fixed

- No visible feedback after clicking `↻` in the About page: explicitly setting the `latestAvailable` state on update detection makes the right-side badge appear immediately; the toast message can also carry a "Download" action button

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- Remote images failed to render: Added `fetch_remote_image_as_data_url` backend command that proxies remote image downloads through the Rust reqwest client, converting them to base64 data URLs to bypass Tauri WebView's CORS, hotlink protection, and network restrictions; the `ContextMenuImage` component now routes `http`-prefixed image srcs through the backend proxy, with fallback to direct WebView loading on backend failure

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Manual update check button next to version number in About page: clicking the `↻` button immediately triggers the `check_update` backend command, bypassing the 24-hour cache limit. This resolves the issue where clients miss new version prompts because the cache window prevents re-checking
- New `forceCheckUpdate` utility function: exported from the `UpdateChecker` module, can be reused by any component to trigger a one-time forced update check

### Fixed

- Toast notifications not visible: removed `opacity: 0` / `transform: translateX(20px)` from the `ToastItem` inline style that was overriding the animation's terminal state, allowing the `toast-enter` keyframe's `forwards` mode to function correctly
- Toast occluded by About page overlay: Toast container z-index raised from `z-50` to `z-[400]` to ensure it covers the `AboutPage` background overlay (z-100) and QR code modal (z-300)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Welcome page recent files single-item close failure: Added `delete_recent_file` backend command, single-item close now synchronously deletes the database record, no longer reappears after refresh

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- F12 easter egg restored: Re-enabled F12 keyboard shortcut to open the easter egg page

### Fixed

- Obsidian Callout icon not displaying: Fixed Admonition callout icon rendering failure caused by escaped syntax `\[!NOTE]` in the example document
- Obsidian Callout escape compatibility: Added support for escaped `\[!TYPE]` syntax in detection regex
- Reader code block font not scaling: Removed `text-[13px]` hardcoded font size on `<pre>` element, changed to `0.9em` relative unit so code block font scales with reading settings

### Changed

- PDF export menu optimization: Marked grayscale mode as "recommended" and moved it after the styled mode

### Added (Chinese description for reference)

### Fixed

- PlantUML dark theme adaptation: Injected theme styles into SVG internals via `injectThemeStyles()` function, solving the problem that external CSS cannot override inline styles
- PlantUML timing/network/gantt/wireframe rendering failure: Confirmed supported diagram types by `@plantuml/core`, replaced unsupported diagrams with alternatives (WBS diagram, use case diagram)
- PlantUML concurrent rendering issue: Implemented serial rendering queue to ensure only one rendering task is processed at a time
- PlantUML `viz-global.js` loading failure: Loaded UMD module by dynamically creating `<script>` tags
- Word export failure: Fixed compatibility issues in `exportDocx.ts`
- Missing i18n translation keys: Added `common.preview`, `common.edit`, `common.cancel`, `common.save`, `quickEdit.unsavedWarning`, `quickEdit.unsaved`, `quickEdit.synced`, `reader.preview` translations

### Changed
